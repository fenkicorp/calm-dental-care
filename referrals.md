At Calm Dental Care, we're happy to receive referrals from other local dentists and professionals. We treat every referral with the utmost care and professionalism, ensuring only treatment previously agreed is carried out and an estimate of fees is always provided to the patient beforehand.

If we feel other treatments are necessary, this will always be discussed with you in advance.

Following initial consultation, patients are given a written treatment plan, a copy of which is also sent to the referring dentist.

Our dedicated team will endeavour to ensure that the referred patient and the referring dentist are happy with the quality of our clinical expertise.

For your convenience, we accept referrals via email to info@calmdental.co.uk
