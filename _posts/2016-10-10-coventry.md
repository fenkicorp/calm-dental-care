On Friday and Saturday last week Charles spent a couple of days in the grand surroundings of Coombe Abbey outside Coventry...

The course was put on by a German dental company called Bredent.  A number of lecturers from across Europe demonstrated technological advances that are helping us to put crowns or bridges onto implants earlier than the historical time frame (of at least 2 months after implant placement).

The Fast and Fixed concept has been around in principle for a while.  But what is different is the combination with Bredentâ€™s slightly fliexible frameworks that can provide strong but very beautiful teeth.  In addition they demonstrated high-tech ways of ensuring that the implant sites are as clean as possible before the implants are placed.

Courses like this are a great opportunity to keep up to date, and share experiences with clinicians from around the world.
