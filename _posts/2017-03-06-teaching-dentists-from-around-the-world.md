It has been a busy weekend as Charles and Matthew were involved in teaching Masters students from around the world who had come to learn about Aesthetic and Restorative Dentistry.

It was great to work with colleagues from varied backgrounds, and humbling to hear about how far some had travelled to get there... from Newcastle to the other side of the world.

With so little time available they were intense days but all the delegates worked hard and it was a really valuable experience.  It is also a good challenge for those of us teaching, because as anyone who has been involved in education knows, it is when you try and explain things to others that you really cement your own knowledge and understanding.

The next time this course rolls into town is May.  With a new group of faces to meet and work with it will be another fun experience weâ€™re sure.
