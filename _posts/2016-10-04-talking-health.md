We had great fun this morning spending half an hour talking about oral health with an enthusiastic and inquisitive group from Urmston Infant School.

As well as learning the anatomy of teeth, we took them through three key health messages:

1. Making good dietary choices

2. Good oral hygiene

3. Visiting the dentist regularly

Such a lot of questions!  We had a quiz on which foods might cause tooth decay, dressed a pupil up as a dentist, had an oral hygiene demonstration with Alexander the Alligator, and finally used the intra-oral camera to have a look in a few willing and open mouths!

They were a terrific group.  If you would like a visit to your school then please drop us an e-mail and we would be delighted to help
