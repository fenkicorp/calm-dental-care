Our practice is quite unusual in bringing two different disciplines together.  Dentistry and Physiotherapy more commonly exist in separate practices but at Calm they co-exist in the same building.

Most of the time the overlap is simply a convenience, plus reassurance for patients who are used to a high level of care in one field and are happy to see it continue in another, but there are cases when the opportunity to work together makes a big difference to the quality of patient care we can offer.

Facial pain is sometimes caused by a problem with the muscles and inner workings of the jaw joint.  Patients often come to the dentist when this pain occurs, but one of the most effective treatments is a course of physiotherapy.  At Calm the opportunity to bring together the skills of dentistry and physiotherapy makes a big difference.

Cathleen, Calmâ€™s physiotherapist, has a special interest in these facial pain conditions.  And it is no coincidence that so does Charles, our principal dentist.  You can find out more about their combined service at www.jawpainclinic.co.uk If you, or someone you know, are suffering from pain around the face, headaches, tension in the muscles then call up to arrange a consultation.
