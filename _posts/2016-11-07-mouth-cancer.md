November is Mouth Cancer Action month.  It is a time where we raise awareness of this condition amongst patients, but we are vigilant all year round for the signs and symptoms.

Like most cancers one of the most important factors for successful treatment is early detection.  So every time we perform a dental check up we also examine the soft tissues to look for the early warning signs of the development of oral cancer.

Things that would concern us would be ulcers that aren’t healing, white patches that don’t go away or have no obvious cause, and certain kinds of swellings.

It is important to state that only a small minority of these will be oral cancer, but we always prefer to make certain and commonly refer patients exhibiting these to hospital.   If you are referred it is for further examination and perhaps a biopsy.

With early detection most patients have successful treatment and a enjoy a full recovery.

It is also important to raise awareness of the risk factors.  The main ones are smoking and alcohol consumption.  By themselves they are each a risk factor, but in combination the risk multiplies.  In some communities chewing betel nut and paan is also a problem.
