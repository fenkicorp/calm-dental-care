Gum disease is a big problem.  It is the most common reason to lose teeth, and we are becoming increasingly aware of associations it may have with other illnesses like heart disease.  

The warning signs are gums that appear redder than normal in appearance and bleed to light touch (like when tooth brushing for example).  As it progresses it can also lead to a loss of bone support around the teeth (which is why they become loose).

Fundamentally, gum disease is caused by plaque - the build up of tiny bits of food which get colonised by bacteria and stick to the teeth near the gumline.  The gums become irritated by the plaque and respond with inflammation.  

This explains the majority of gum disease but it is not quite the whole story, as your genetics and medical history may also influence the level to which these bacteria can damage your mouth.

But the big questions is “What can we do?”

Over a series of blog posts we will discuss this in more detail, but the most important take home message is this: what you do at home that is the most important part!
