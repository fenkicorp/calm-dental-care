In this blogpost we will look at home care.  The most important steps are ones that are in your control. The primary goal is to keep your teeth clean, so that there is no plaque build up in the area of the gums.  This involves:

* Thorough toothbrushing, especially allowing the bristles of the brush to gently work around the gumline where each tooth emerges.  It doesn’t need to be vigorous or hard brushing, which may actually cause damage, but it does need to be thorough

* Use a toothpaste that contains triclosan (with copolymer), as this ingredient actively works against the plaque

* Also, clean between the teeth.  These are the areas that your toothbrush won’t reach.  You can achieve this with floss or interdental brushes depending on the size of the space between your teeth.

* If you get periods where the gum bleeding (gingivitis) is particularly bad then a mouth wash that contains chlorhexidine is useful (such as Corsodyl).  However if the bleeding continues then make sure you come in and see the dentist.

* Look after your general health.  Particularly think about giving up smoking if that is relevant to you.  You are more likely to develop gum disease if you are a smoker and treatment will be less effective.
