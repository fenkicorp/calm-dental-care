We’ve taken them for granted.  We’ve become complacent over our relationship.  We’ve abused them.  This just isn’t working anymore.

‘We’ are the medical professionals and patients, and ‘they’ are of course... antibiotics.  It is difficult for us to even contemplate what life would be like without antibiotics.  For a start many of us would no longer be here, having lost our lives to what are currently seen as innocuous infections.  And for the infections that we can survive, treatment might mean surgical removal of the offending affected anatomy or even a return to the blood sucking leeches of the medicine of the past!

That sounds like a nightmare, and it is, but it has the potential to become a reality.  In USA 23,000 people a year die as a result of getting an infection that can no longer be treated by antibiotics.

We have to do something about it, and these are the most important things from our point of view are:

1. prevention - maintain good health and a well functioning immune system through self care and a balanced diet

2. treat the cause of the infection, don’t just subdue it with antibiotics.  In the dental world this might mean good oral hygiene, or a root filling to resolve an abscess

3. only use antibiotics where there is a clear bacterial cause (i.e. not for a viral condition like the common cold)

These three things are all within our grasp, and we can work together to do our bit.
