Anti wrinkle injections (BOTOX) can be used to relax the wrinkle causing muscles and create a smoothed rejuvenated appearance.

Derma fillers can help smooth out the appearance of deeper lines.



Natural or Significantly Smoother

Botox and fillers can be used in varying degrees from a slight freshen up with natural results (in other words no-one needs to know!) through to a significantly smoother appearance.

You can also choose where you want to target, the 3 main areas are forehead, crows feet and concentration lines between the eyebrows. You can choose to target 1,2 or all 3 areas.



Is it safe?

Botox is now widely used in the NHS, it is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for complaints such at migraines, stiff  muscles and incontinence and as such has been widely tested for its suitability for blocking signals from the nerves to muscles.

Risks are very minor with using Botox in facial aesthetics as it is injected in very small amounts, however Liam will talk through all of your concerns in your consultation meeting.

First Step…



If you are considering using Botox and/or fillers for the first time we’d highly recommend booking a Free consultation with Dr Liam Wilson, Dr Matthew Kitchen, or Anna Lewis where you can talk through all of your concerns and questions and have reassurance that you can have the result you want in a 'no-pressure to proceed’ environment.
