At Calm Dental Care we understand that there’s no such thing as ‘basic’ dentistry. Your regular check-up, hygienist appointment and any minor treatments you may need pay an absolutely vital role in maintaining your oral health.

While Calm Dental Care completes many advanced treatments, most of our patients come to us for everyday dentistry. We develop treatment plans tailored to your needs, picking up any problems early, so treatments are kept as simple as possible.
