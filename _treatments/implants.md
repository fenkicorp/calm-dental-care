We can help restore your mouth to full function with dental implants.  They don’t drop out like dentures can, and won’t damage your natural teeth like bridgework does.  They really are fantastic!

At Calm Dental Care we place implants made by Dentsply (Ankylos and Astra), Bredent and Adin Implants.

If you would like to find out more about this treatment why not book an appointment to talk about it with the dentist?
