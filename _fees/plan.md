<h3>Membership Plan</h3>

Our aim is to provide high quality care and treatment in a relaxed, comfortable and safe environment. We are committed to continuing eduacation and keeping abreast of advances in modern dentistry. To ensure we maintain the high standards our patients have come to expect it is becoming increasingly important for us to accurately match the number and the needs of our patients to the resources we have available.

Research shows that preventive dentistry delivered on a regular basis greatly reduces the risk of dental disease and provides a platform for a lifetime of improved oral health. We encourage such an approach and with this in mind we have joined with DPAS Limited to design a dental plan to reward loyal patients. This plan will be administered by DPAS who will make a separate arrangement with you to manage your payments under the plan. The plan will provide advantages both to you and to us. It will allow us to plan your dental care more effectively and provide the best chance of keeping you dentally fit. The advatange for you is that it should reduce the need for future treatment and you will have the peace of mind that all of your preventive dental care will be covered by convenient monthly payments. Our plan also provides worldwide Supplementary Insurance for dental emergencies or dental injuries whilst at home or abroad
